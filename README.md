# A Simple Python Wordcloud Project

This is my first python project. A single word wordcloud.
It was my starting point for more complicated wordclouds.

## How to make a this simple wordcloud:

- read the comments in the python file
- read the [wordcloud documentation](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloudS)

### Things I learned

- The image you wish to use as a mask has to have a background.
  - Maybe there are ways to make an image with a transparent image work. I don't know about it yet.
- If you want to use other languages in the worldcloud, make sure to use a font that supports it.

Result:
